## üìã Requirements

- Claude conversational web interface https://claude.ai/new
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- Text-based interface (no GUI dependencies)

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vm-interface.git
cd vm-interface
```

2. No additional installation required - the VM runs entirely in your conversation interface.

## üíª Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Arithmetic operations
calculate 42 + 58
what's the square root of 144

# Advanced math
find the factorial of 7
is 17 prime?

# String operations
reverse "hello world"
convert "test" to uppercase

# Memory operations
store this as x: 100
load x
clear memory

# Theme management
switch to matrix theme
show all themes
what theme am I using?
```

### Advanced Examples

#### Complex Calculations
```bash
# Chain operations
add 5 and 7 then multiply by 3

# Statistical analysis
analyze these numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

# Unit conversions
convert 100 fahrenheit to celsius
```

#### Memory and Registers
```bash
# Store computation results
COMPUTE mul 6 7
MEMORY store result 42

# Use registers for calculations
REG A 10
REG B 20
COMPUTE add A B
```

#### Stack Operations
```bash
STACK push 10
STACK push 20
STACK push 30
STACK pop
```
